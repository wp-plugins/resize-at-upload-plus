Automatically resize (i.e. scale down) images after uploading. Save disk space and preserve your layout

== Description ==

This plugin is basically just a little improvement of [Resize-At-Upload](http://dev.huiz.net/2008/10/04/plugin-resize-at-upload-english/ "Resize-At-Upload"), a fabulous plugin by A. Huizinga.

The plugin will automatically resize an image upon upload, depending on the maximum width and height that you define. Gone are the days when you, or your client, will ruin a site's layout by uploading a huge file with 25 megapixels.
Be advised: there is no backup, no copy of the originally uploaded image.

The plugin uses a class originally from Jacob Wyke (www.redvodkajelly.com).
